descriptionEn: >-
  The studio advocates an experimental approach as a form of individual
  research. There is no ‘studio style’, but students are encouraged to develop a
  well-argued position as a fundament of their project work. We also encourage a
  collaborative approach and students are often required to work in pairs as a
  way developing solutions that come from discussion and well formulated
  argument.
