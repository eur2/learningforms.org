  Building register is research programme which examines historically
  significant buildings as references within the current architectural debate on
  housing and urbanism. The programme takes the form of a series of surveys
  documenting both the general characteristics of projects and selected areas of
  detailed study. 


  The building are explored both at the urban scale and in detail at the level
  of a single room or construction assembly. This may include the internal
  structure of a large residential complex in relation to its urban form, or the
  defining presence of a material or detail in view of the effect they have on
  the urban context. 


  Significant emphasis is placed on the graphic  representation of the phenomena
  under observation and their analysis. The art of drawing is therefore central
  to this study. 


  Each study is carried out of a small groups of students to encourage the
  development of a strong sense of collaboration, the sharing of research and
  joint authorship. By reflecting the reality of professional work, the
  programme aims to provide an initiation and a foundation for future practice.
